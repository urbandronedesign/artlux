# 9. 3D scene

The **3D Scene** lays out fixtures in real‑world space and previews the show in 3D — handy for venue
design and client previews. It lives as a **split pane** beside the Stage (toggle it with the
split‑view button in the Stage's top‑right toolbar; drag the divider to resize).

*The 3D Scene (center‑right) with its outliner: OBJECTS (a "Screen 1" plane, models), FIXTURES, and a LIGHTING section. The LEDs light up with live output colors, so the view matches what your rig is doing.*

## Transform a fixture in 3D

Select a fixture, then **W** move / **E** rotate / **R** scale (or the gizmo buttons), and drag the
gizmo. For exact values, use the Inspector's **3D Layout** card:

- **Position (m)** — X / Y / Z in metres.
- **Rotation** — pitch / yaw / roll (degrees).
- **Layout** — `line` (spacing), `matrix` (cols / rows / serpentine), or `arc` (radius / angle). This is
  the *physical* arrangement of the LEDs in space, independent of the 2D stage placement.

## The outliner (top‑right of the pane)

Lists everything in the scene under **OBJECTS** and **FIXTURES**:

- **Add** screen **planes** (the **+** in OBJECTS) to show surface/timeline content on a flat panel in
  3D — useful as a backdrop or projection screen.
- **Load a venue model** (`.glb` / `.gltf`) via the Media library or the outliner, then position/scale
  it.
- Toggle each item's **visibility** (the eye), select it to edit, or remove it.
- **Save** the scene layout from the outliner header.

## Lighting & preview options

The **LIGHTING** section controls the preview render: **Light gain**, **Exposure**, **Ambient (env)**,
**Reflective floor**, **Grid**, plus **Tracking zones (LiDAR)** and **Merge people** for visualizing
live tracking in 3D.

See [SCENES.md](../SCENES.md) for the full 3D model.

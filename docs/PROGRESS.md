| G | 3D LED fixture editor + simulator (r3f) | ⏳ todo (independent) | — |

## What works today
- Runs as a native **Electron** desktop app: `npm run dev` (electron-vite). Three-process build: main / preload / renderer.
- **Native Art-Net** over UDP from the main process (`src/main/transport/artnet.ts`), wired via IPC (`shared/protocol.ts`, `src/preload/index.ts`, `src/main/ipc.ts`). The old WebSocket bridge is gone.
- **WebGPU compute** pixel mapper (`src/renderer/gpu/WebGPUMapper.ts`) with WebGL fallback (`src/renderer/services/GPUMapper.ts`) behind a shared `IPixelMapper` interface. Stage tries WebGPU first.

## Repo layout (post Phase A)
```
electron.vite.config.ts        shared/protocol.ts (IPC contract)
src/main/{index,ipc}.ts        src/main/transport/artnet.ts
src/preload/index.ts
src/renderer/                  (the React app)
  App.tsx index.html index.tsx types.ts
  components/  hooks/  services/  gpu/
```

## Key decisions
- **Hybrid native** (decided pre-build): Electron + React + WebGPU; only the high-rate output engine goes to **Rust (napi-rs)** in Phase F. No full Tauri/Rust rewrite (would break reliable WebGPU). See ARCHITECTURE_PLAN "Native-language assessment".
- **`package.json` has no `"type": "module"`** — main/preload build as CJS so the `sandbox: true` preload works. Renderer is still ESM (Vite handles it).
- **AppSettings** changed: `useWsBridge`/`wsBridgeUrl` → `outputEnabled`/`broadcast`.
- **WebGPU readback is async** → `WebGPUMapper.read()` returns the previous resolved frame (1-frame latency) via a 3-buffer staging ring. Acceptable for lighting.
- **Universe packing still CPU-side** in `Stage.tick` (the DMX Monitor also needs the per-LED buffer). Moving packing onto the GPU is a deferred Phase-B refinement.

## Gotchas / environment notes (for future-me)
- This dev sandbox sets **`ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`**, which makes the Electron binary run as plain Node (`app` undefined). Launch with `env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE npm run dev`. A normal user terminal won't have this.
- The `electron` npm **postinstall was skipped** here; if `node_modules/electron/path.txt` is missing, run `node node_modules/electron/install.js`.
- Use `ELECTRON_ENABLE_LOGGING=1` to surface renderer `console.log` on stdout when verifying.
- WebGPU **is** available in this Electron/Chromium (confirmed: "Using WebGPU compute mapper").

## Open items
- **ui-ux-pro-max skill** not yet vendored: the `uipro-cli` global install was blocked by the sandbox. Plan: copy `src/ui-ux-pro-max/` from the named GitHub repo into `.claude/skills/` (needs approval). Skill is already usable in-session meanwhile.
- **Parity check**: WebGPU vs WebGL pixel output verified only as "initializes + runs"; confirm visually with a loaded source against the DMX Monitor.

## Verification cheatsheet
- Build: `npm run build` (compiles main+preload+renderer).
- Run: `env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE npm run dev`.
- Art-Net bytes: a UDP listener on `127.0.0.1:6454` + the transport produces a valid `Art-Net` OpOutput packet (header, `0x5000`, universe, length, payload, non-zero seq) — validated during Phase A.
